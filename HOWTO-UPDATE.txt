		 How to update the build script
		 ==============================


* Download  the tarball  from SlackBuilds  and start  from there.
  This way  we merge in our  version the changes they  did to the
  thing to make it compliant.

   <http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/development/zile/>

* If  there is  one:  remove  from the  .info  file the  variable
  setting for  APPROVED; there  must be no  such variable  in the
  uploaded tarball.

* Notice  that   the  "category"  at  the   Slackbuilds  site  is
  "development".

* Copy  the file  "zile.SlackBuild" from  the  downloaded tarball
  into the local copy and update the version number.

* Check differences  between the downloaded  file "zile.info" and
  the local copy, and update  the version numbers and the MD5 sum
  of the upstream tarball:

    $ md5sum zile-2.4.7.tar.gz

* Check out the instructions at:

	      <http://slackbuilds.org/guidelines/>
	       <http://slackbuilds.org/templates/>
		 <http://slackbuilds.org/howto/>

* To build the package run:

    $ make package

  the package is  left in "/tmp", then install  it as usual under
  "/usr".

* To build the tarball to be uploaded to slackbuilds.org run:

    $ make tarball

  fill the  submission form  taking the searchable  keywords from
  the zile package page at:

   <http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/development/zile/>
